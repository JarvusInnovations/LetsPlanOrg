        <h1>About OurPlan</h1>
        <p>
          OurPlan started as a student project in the Master of Urban Spatial Analytics
          program at the University of Pennsylvania, but has since evolved into an open
          platform we hope can help guide development decisions in changing neighborhoods.
          While not fully automated, OurPlan can currently be deployed in any Philadelphia
          neighborhood.
        </p>

          We are still discovering who can benefit from OurPlan but we foresee potential users
          including neighborhood groups, the Planning Commission, City Councilpersons, and bespoke
          community engagement endeavors. Weâ€™d love to talk to you about how OurPlan can help!
